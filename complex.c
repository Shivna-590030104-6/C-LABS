#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int age, income, credit_score;
    printf("Enter age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    printf("Enter income: ");
    scanf("%d", &income);
    printf("Enter credit score: ");
    scanf("%d", &credit_score);

    if (age >= 21 && age <= 60 && income > 35000 && credit_score >= 750)
    {
        printf("The person is eligible for a loan.\n");
    }
    else
